Do Bilateral Labor Agreements increase Migration? Global evidence from 1960 to 2020.

This paper uses the most comprehensive dataset on bilateral migration stocks, covering the period from 1960 to 2020 in ten-year intervals. Migration stock data for 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 are sourced from the World Bank (2022), while data for 2010 and 2020 are drawn from UNDESA (2020), which employs a similar methodology. In these datasets, a migrant is defined as an individual residing in a country different from their country of birth. In addition, we incorporate data on BLAs from Chilton et Woda (2022), the most comprehensive collection of BLAs to date, comprising 1,222 agreements signed between countries since World War II including information on the year of each BLA and the countries involved. To match the migration data format, we transform the BLA data by identifying the country of origin, the country of destination, and aligning each BLA with the corresponding year in the migration data. For instance, a BLA signed between 1970 and 1979 is assigned to t=1980 in the migration dataset. For consistency, we classify the country with the lower GDP per capita as the "origin" country and the other as the "destination" country. Origin-destination-year cells without a recorded BLA are assumed to have no agreement in place.
